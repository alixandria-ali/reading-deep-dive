## 🔍 Critical Patterns Identified

!!! danger "Pattern 1: Over-Acceleration Without Consolidation"
    **Severity:** CRITICAL | **Prevalence:** 18-22% of students

    Students placed in Grade 12 Reading, SAT, or 100 for 100 programs show **negative growth** (-8 to -6 Growth X) when foundational comprehension (HMG < 9) is insufficient.

    **Example:** Adrienne Laswell - G11 Hole-filling + SAT Level 3, HMG 7, Growth X **-8**

    **Root Cause:** Placement driven by acceleration targets rather than demonstrated comprehension mastery

    **Action:** Immediate placement audit for all students with HMG < 9 in SAT/advanced programs

!!! warning "Pattern 2: Curriculum-MAP Assessment Misalignment"
    **Severity:** HIGH | **Prevalence:** 15-20% of students

    Students make progress in curriculum but show flat or declining MAP RIT scores, suggesting the **curriculum doesn't align** with what MAP assesses.

    **Example:** Students advancing in 100 for 100 but RIT declining 3-8 points

    **Root Cause:** Curriculum focuses on speed/completion rather than MAP-assessed comprehension skills

    **Action:** Add weekly MAP-aligned practice to all Reading courses

!!! warning "Pattern 3: Reading Stamina Plateau"
    **Severity:** HIGH | **Prevalence:** 12-15% of advanced readers

    Students at Grade 11-12 Reading show minimal growth (0-2 Growth X) despite high initial RIT (>230), indicating a **complexity ceiling**.

    **Example:** Student at RIT 240 shows 1 Growth X over term despite daily engagement

    **Root Cause:** Curriculum lacks sufficient text complexity and academic vocabulary at upper levels

    **Action:** Introduce college-level texts and AP-style analysis tasks

!!! success "Pattern 4: Foundational Skills First Model"
    **Severity:** SUCCESS | **Success Rate:** 82% exceed 2X target

    Students who complete **phonics/decoding foundations** before advancing to comprehension show exceptional growth (6-10 Growth X average).

    **Example:** Students using ClearFluency + grade-level content average 8 Growth X

    **Root Cause:** Strong decoding enables independent practice and faster comprehension gains

    **Action:** Prioritize foundational skills for all students with RIT < 200

## 🎯 Top 3 Issues Requiring Immediate Action

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **#1 Over-Acceleration Crisis**

    ---

    **Impact:** 18-22% of students in SAT/advanced without prerequisites

    **Consequence:** -8 to -6 Growth X, RIT regression, reading frustration

    **Cost of Inaction:** Students may develop reading aversion and require intensive remediation

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: View Placement Audit Protocol](reports/campus_breakdown.md)

-   **#2 Curriculum-MAP Disconnect**

    ---

    **Impact:** 15-20% progressing in curriculum but declining in MAP

    **Consequence:** False sense of progress, unprepared for assessments

    **Cost of Inaction:** Students unprepared for state testing and college entrance exams

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: View Intervention Strategies](reports/reading_analysis.md)

-   **#3 Advanced Reader Plateau**

    ---

    **Impact:** 12-15% of advanced readers hitting complexity ceiling

    **Consequence:** Minimal growth, untapped potential, boredom

    **Cost of Inaction:** Loss of critical years for advanced literacy development
