## 1. Key Findings

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Reading: Course Placement**

    ---

    - Wide range: Hole-filling courses through SAT Level 4
    - Some students in Grade 12 reading while in lower grades (e.g., Ryder Shilt: Grade 6, Reading Grade 12)
    - **Advanced placement common** but not always translating to growth

-   **Reading: Growth Distribution**

    ---

    - High performers: Luca Sanchez (15 Growth X), Stella Grams (16 Growth X), Geetesh Parelly (14 Growth X), Estella Estrada (10 Growth X)
    - Low/negative growth: Erika Rigby (-6 Growth X), Ju Orloff (-8 Growth X)
    - Most students clustering around 1-5 Growth X

-   **Reading: Mastery Gaps**

    ---

    - Pattern of high HMG (6-12) with lower effective grades mastered
    - Suggests **completion without true mastery** or **assessment misalignment**

</div>

---

## 2. Inference: Root Cause Analysis

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Issue 1: Over-Acceleration**

    ---

    **Pattern:** Students placed multiple grade levels above age grade in reading courses

    **Evidence:**
    - Ryder Shilt (Grade 6): Reading Grade 12 course, HMG 9
    - River Thomas (Grade 9): Already at Grade 12 reading, HMG 9
    - Multiple students at SAT-level reading in Grade 9-10

    **Inference:** Placement based on initial assessment may not account for sustained mastery. Students "place out" quickly but don't consolidate learning, leading to negative growth when assessed.

-   **Issue 2: Assessment vs. Instruction Misalignment**

    ---

    **Pattern:** High HMG with negative or low growth X

    **Evidence:**
    - Ju Orloff: HMG 6, Growth X -8
    - Erika Rigby: HMG 6, Growth X -6
    - Multiple students with HMG 6-12 but Growth X < 2

    **Inference:** MAP assessments may be sampling skills not reinforced in 100 for 100 or SAT reading courses. Curriculum-assessment gap.

-   **Issue 3: Reading Stamina / Complexity Plateau**

    ---

    **Pattern:** Students succeed in structured reading programs but struggle when complexity increases

    **Evidence:**
    - Students completing Grade 10-12 reading courses but showing minimal or negative growth
    - High completion rates (HMG 6-12) but low Growth X

    **Inference:** Programs may prioritize comprehension of discrete passages over building reading stamina, vocabulary depth, and complex text analysis—skills MAP assesses.

## 3. Student Risk Categories

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **High Risk: Immediate Intervention Required**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X < 0 (regression) OR HMG < Age Grade - 2

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Issue |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-------|
    | Ju Orloff | 10 | 6 | -8 | Curriculum-assessment gap |
    | Erika Rigby | 9 | 6 | -6 | Acceleration without consolidation |

    **Action Priority:** Review placement, diagnose skill gaps, consider course change or intensive support.

-   **Moderate Risk: Monitoring Required**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X between 0.5 and 1.5 (below target but not regressing)

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Issue |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-------|
    | Sloka Vudumu | 11 | 6 | 1.0 | High HMG but minimal growth |
    | Hinano Tamura | 9 | 6 | 2.67 | Just above target |

    **Action Priority:** Weekly check-ins, adjust difficulty/pacing, monitor engagement signals.

-   **Strong Performers: Leverage as Models**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X greater than or equal to 5.0

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Strengths |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-----------|
    | Stella Grams | 10 | 5 | 16.0 | SAT Level 4, exceptional growth |
    | Luca Sanchez | 9 | 6 | 15.0 | Hole-filling + grade-level combo |
    | Geetesh Parelly | 11 | 6 | 14.0 | Self-directed learner |
    | Estella Estrada | 10 | 5 | 10.0 | 100 for 100 program success |

    **Insight:** Top performers often use **combination strategies** (hole-filling + grade-level course, or multiple complementary courses).

- Document: Time on task, help-seeking behavior, task completion patterns
- Interview students about perceived difficulty, interest, goals
- Implement accountability structures (daily check-ins, weekly mastery goals)

**Owner:** Campus staff + instructional coaches
**Timeline:** Observations complete Week 2, interventions start Week 3

---

### Short-Term Interventions (Next 4-6 Weeks)

#### 4. Reading-MAP Alignment Review
**Target:** All reading programs (100 for 100, SAT Reading, Core Knowledge)

**Action Steps:**
- Map program content to MAP reading domains (literary/informational text, vocabulary, inference)
- Identify gaps between curriculum coverage and MAP sampling
- Add targeted practice for underrepresented MAP domains
- Pilot supplementary passages weekly that mirror MAP complexity

**Owner:** Curriculum team + reading teachers
**Timeline:** Analysis complete Week 4, pilot Week 5-6

---

#### 5. Bi-Weekly Growth Review Meetings

- Flag any student showing flat or declining trajectory
- Adjust course difficulty, pacing, or support immediately
- Track intervention effectiveness with control group comparison

**Owner:** Data team + campus leads
**Timeline:** Start Week 3, ongoing

---

### Long-Term Strategies (Next Quarter)

#### 6. Develop "Mastery Milestones" Within Courses
**Target:** All Reading courses

**Action Steps:**
- Break each course into 4-6 mastery checkpoints
- Require 85%+ mastery before advancing to next unit
- Track time-to-milestone (identify students taking too long)
- Prevent advancement without true mastery (not just completion)

**Owner:** Curriculum design team
**Timeline:** Design Q2, pilot Q3, full rollout Q4

---

#### 7. Build "Exemplar Student" Case Studies
**Target:** Top 10 performers (Stella Grams, Luca Sanchez, Geetesh Parelly, etc.)

**Action Steps:**
- Interview students: What's working? What's your routine? What challenges did you overcome?
- Document their course combinations, study habits, support structures
- Create reproducible playbook for other students
- Pair struggling students with exemplar mentors

**Owner:** Student success team
**Timeline:** Interviews Q2, playbook Q3, mentorship Q4

---

#### 8. Pilot "Adaptive Pacing" in Reading
**Target:** Selected campuses

**Action Steps:**
- Allow students to progress through content at mastery-driven pace (not time-based)
- Use high performer cases as proof-of-concept
- Track mastery depth vs. breadth trade-offs
- Compare adaptive cohort to traditional pacing cohort

**Owner:** Reading teachers + instructional coach
**Timeline:** Pilot design Q2, launch Q3, evaluate Q4

## 6. Monitoring & Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Current Baseline | 6-Week Target | 12-Week Target |
|--------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| % Students with Growth X greater than or equal to 2.0 | CALCULATE | 65% | 80% |
| % Students with Negative Growth | ~10% (estimated) | < 5% | < 2% |
| Avg Growth X (Reading) | CALCULATE | 4.5 | 6.5 |
| % Students with HMG = Age Grade | CALCULATE | +15% | +30% |

### Weekly Tracking Dashboard

Implement dashboard showing:
- Students with declining Growth X week-over-week
- Students with flat Growth X (no change in 3+ weeks)
- Students with engagement red flags (low session time, high error rates)
- Intervention status for all flagged students

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Potential Barriers to Implementation

| Barrier | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| Resistance to course changes mid-year | Frame as "optimization" not "failure"; involve students in decision |
| Staff capacity for individualized observation | Use peer observation model; rotating responsibility |
| Data lag (waiting for MAP results) | Use in-course assessments weekly; don't wait for external tests |
| Over-reliance on single metric (Growth X) | Balance with qualitative signals: engagement, mastery checkpoints |
| Student/parent pushback on "de-leveling" | Show data; emphasize mastery over grade level; highlight success stories |

---

## 8. Conclusion

The Reading cohort data reveals **clear, actionable patterns**:

1. **Placement accuracy** is the highest-leverage intervention point
2. **Combination courses** (hole-filling + grade-level) outperform single-track approaches
3. **Negative growth is preventable** with early detection and rapid adjustment
4. **Exemplar students** demonstrate reproducible success strategies
5. **Curriculum-MAP alignment** gaps are systematic and fixable

**Next Steps:**
1. Share this analysis with campus leadership
2. Assign owners to each recommendation
3. Launch Week 2 interventions (placement audits, engagement diagnostics)
4. Track progress weekly using KPI dashboard
5. Iterate based on data, not assumptions
