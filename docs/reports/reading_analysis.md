## 1. Key Findings

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Reading: Course Placement**

    ---

    - Wide range: Hole-filling courses through SAT Level 4
    - Some students in Grade 12 reading while in lower grades (e.g., Ryder Shilt: Grade 6, Reading Grade 12)
    - **Advanced placement common** but not always translating to growth

-   **Reading: Growth Distribution**

    ---

    - High performers: Luca Sanchez (15 Growth X), Stella Grams (16 Growth X), Geetesh Parelly (14 Growth X), Estella Estrada (10 Growth X)
    - Low/negative growth: Erika Rigby (-6 Growth X), Ju Orloff (-8 Growth X)
    - Most students clustering around 1-5 Growth X

-   **Reading: Mastery Gaps**

    ---

    - Pattern of high HMG (6-12) with lower effective grades mastered
    - Suggests **completion without true mastery** or **assessment misalignment**

</div>

## 2. Inference: Root Cause Analysis

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Issue 1: Over-Acceleration**

    ---

    **Pattern:** Students placed multiple grade levels above age grade in reading courses

    **Evidence:**
    - Ryder Shilt (Grade 6): Reading Grade 12 course, HMG 9
    - River Thomas (Grade 9): Already at Grade 12 reading, HMG 9
    - Multiple students at SAT-level reading in Grade 9-10

    **Inference:** Placement based on initial assessment may not account for sustained mastery. Students "place out" quickly but don't consolidate learning, leading to negative growth when assessed.

-   **Issue 2: Assessment vs. Instruction Misalignment**

    ---

    **Pattern:** High HMG with negative or low growth X

    **Evidence:**
    - Ju Orloff: HMG 6, Growth X -8
    - Erika Rigby: HMG 6, Growth X -6
    - Multiple students with HMG 6-12 but Growth X < 2

    **Inference:** MAP assessments may be sampling skills not reinforced in 100 for 100 or SAT reading courses. Curriculum-assessment gap.

-   **Issue 3: Reading Stamina / Complexity Plateau**

    ---

    **Pattern:** Students succeed in structured reading programs but struggle when complexity increases

    **Evidence:**
    - Students completing Grade 10-12 reading courses but showing minimal or negative growth
    - High completion rates (HMG 6-12) but low Growth X

    **Inference:** Programs may prioritize comprehension of discrete passages over building reading stamina, vocabulary depth, and complex text analysis—skills MAP assesses.

## 3. Student Risk Categories

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **High Risk: Immediate Intervention Required**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X < 0 (regression) OR HMG < Age Grade - 2

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Issue |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-------|
    | Ju Orloff | 10 | 6 | -8 | Curriculum-assessment gap |
    | Erika Rigby | 9 | 6 | -6 | Acceleration without consolidation |

    **Action Priority:** Review placement, diagnose skill gaps, consider course change or intensive support.

-   **Moderate Risk: Monitoring Required**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X between 0.5 and 1.5 (below target but not regressing)

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Issue |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-------|
    | Sloka Vudumu | 11 | 6 | 1.0 | High HMG but minimal growth |
    | Hinano Tamura | 9 | 6 | 2.67 | Just above target |

    **Action Priority:** Weekly check-ins, adjust difficulty/pacing, monitor engagement signals.

-   **Strong Performers: Leverage as Models**

    ---

    **Criteria:** Growth X greater than or equal to 5.0

    | Student | Age Grade | HMG | Growth X | Strengths |
    |---------|-----------|-----|----------|-----------|
    | Stella Grams | 10 | 5 | 16.0 | SAT Level 4, exceptional growth |
    | Luca Sanchez | 9 | 6 | 15.0 | Hole-filling + grade-level combo |
    | Geetesh Parelly | 11 | 6 | 14.0 | Self-directed learner |
    | Estella Estrada | 10 | 5 | 10.0 | 100 for 100 program success |

    **Insight:** Top performers often use **combination strategies** (hole-filling + grade-level course, or multiple complementary courses).

## 4. Cohort-Level Patterns

### By Grade Level

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **High School (HS)**

    ---

    - **Widest performance variance** (Growth X from -8 to +16)
    - AP/advanced courses correlate with **both highest and lowest** growth
    - **Course selection matters more than grade level**

-   **Middle School (MS)**

    ---

    - **More consistent outcomes** (fewer outliers)
    - Smaller sample size limits inference
    - Ryder Shilt (Grade 6 in Grade 12 Reading): Unique case, merits individual analysis

-   **Elementary (L1, L2, LL)**

    ---

    - Reading data shows **foundational skill-building phase**
    - Less variability, fewer extreme outcomes

</div>

### By Campus

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Alpha High School**

    ---

    - Largest cohort in dataset
    - High concentration of **AP/advanced coursework**
    - Performance split between **very high achievers** and **struggling students**
    - Suggests need for **placement accuracy improvement**

-   **Alpha School Miami**

## 5. Possible Action

#### 1. Placement Audits for High-Risk Students
**Target:** All students with Growth X < 0

**Action Steps:**
- Conduct diagnostic assessments to identify specific skill gaps
- Compare current course level to prerequisite mastery
- Make placement adjustments (move to appropriate course or add support)
- Schedule parent/student conferences to explain changes

---

#### 2. Institute "Combination Course" Model for Struggling Students
**Target:** Students with HMG < Age Grade - 2

**Action Steps:**
- Pair grade-level content with targeted hole-filling
- Model after successful cases (Luca Sanchez: 15 Growth X)
- Schedule both courses daily, not alternating
- Monitor weekly progress on both tracks

---

#### 3. Engagement Diagnostics for "Low Intensity" Cases
**Target:** Students with high HMG but Growth X < 1.5

**Action Steps:**
- Observe 2-3 learning sessions per student
- Document: Time on task, help-seeking behavior, task completion patterns
- Interview students about perceived difficulty, interest, goals
- Implement accountability structures (daily check-ins, weekly mastery goals)

---

#### 4. Reading-MAP Alignment Review
**Target:** All reading programs (100 for 100, SAT Reading, Core Knowledge)

**Action Steps:**
- Map program content to MAP reading domains (literary/informational text, vocabulary, inference)
- Identify gaps between curriculum coverage and MAP sampling
- Add targeted practice for underrepresented MAP domains
- Pilot supplementary passages weekly that mirror MAP complexity

---

#### 5. Bi-Weekly Growth Review Meetings
**Target:** All students in Reading

**Action Steps:**
- Pull Growth X data every 2 weeks (not just term-end)
- Flag any student showing flat or declining trajectory
- Adjust course difficulty, pacing, or support immediately
- Track intervention effectiveness with control group comparison

---

#### 6. Develop "Mastery Milestones" Within Courses
**Target:** All Reading courses

**Action Steps:**
- Break each course into 4-6 mastery checkpoints
- Require 85%+ mastery before advancing to next unit
- Track time-to-milestone (identify students taking too long)
- Prevent advancement without true mastery (not just completion)

---

#### 7. Build "Exemplar Student" Case Studies
**Target:** Top 10 performers (Stella Grams, Luca Sanchez, Geetesh Parelly, etc.)

**Action Steps:**
- Interview students: What's working? What's your routine? What challenges did you overcome?
- Document their course combinations, study habits, support structures
- Create reproducible playbook for other students
- Pair struggling students with exemplar mentors

---

#### 8. Pilot "Adaptive Pacing" in Reading
**Target:** Selected campuses

**Action Steps:**
- Allow students to progress through content at mastery-driven pace (not time-based)
- Use high performer cases as proof-of-concept
- Track mastery depth vs. breadth trade-offs
- Compare adaptive cohort to traditional pacing cohort

---

## 6. Conclusion

The Reading cohort data reveals **clear, actionable patterns**:

1. **Placement accuracy** is the highest-leverage intervention point
2. **Combination courses** (hole-filling + grade-level) outperform single-track approaches
3. **Negative growth is preventable** with early detection and rapid adjustment
4. **Exemplar students** demonstrate reproducible success strategies
5. **Curriculum-MAP alignment** gaps are systematic and fixable

**Next Steps:**
