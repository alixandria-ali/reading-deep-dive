This comprehensive directory provides detailed performance profiles for all 423 students with Reading data, organized by risk level based on Fall-to-Winter 2025 Growth X scores. Each profile includes subject-specific performance metrics, intelligent cross-subject analysis, and targeted action recommendations.

## Understanding Growth X

**Growth X** represents how many times the typical student growth a student has achieved. For example:
- Growth X of 2 = twice the typical growth
- Growth X of 1 = typical expected growth
- Growth X of 0 = no growth
- Growth X of -1 = regression equivalent to typical growth amount

## Risk Level System

Students are categorized into five risk levels based on their **Combined Score** (sum of highest Reading/Science Growth X scores):

| Risk Level | Growth X Range | Definition | Action Timeline |
|------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Critical Risk | < -5 | Significant regression requiring immediate intervention | **Emergency** - Within 24-48 hours |
| High Risk | -5 to 0 | Below-target growth needing urgent support | **Urgent** - Within 1 week |
| Moderate Risk | 0 to 5 | Some growth but below optimal trajectory | **Important** - Within 2-3 weeks |
| Low Risk | 5 to 10 | Good progress approaching targets | **Monitor** - Ongoing support |
| Exceeding | > 10 | Exceptional growth exceeding expectations | **Celebrate** - Enrichment opportunities |
