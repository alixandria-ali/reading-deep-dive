!!! abstract "Overview"
    Comprehensive campus-level analysis for **Reading performance** across 18 campuses. This report identifies systematic issues, quantifies growth patterns, and provides data-driven recommendations for targeted interventions.

    **Data Period:** Fall 2025 to Winter 2025 | **Students Analyzed:** 459 Reading

## Reading Performance Analysis

### Top 3 Systematic Issues

**Issue 1: Foundational Gaps (HIGH SEVERITY)**

104 students (22.7%)

Students with low mastery levels (<6) failed to meet growth targets, indicating need for intensive foundational intervention in phonics, fluency, and basic comprehension skills.

**Recommendation:** Deploy targeted foundational reading interventions; consider small-group or 1-on-1 tutoring for lowest performers.

**Issue 2: Advanced Placement (HIGH SEVERITY)**

29 students (6.3%)

Students in grades 6+ experienced negative growth, suggesting challenges with complex text comprehension, reading stamina, or inference skills required at higher levels.

**Recommendation:** Add reading stamina-building exercises; implement graduated complexity scaffolding for advanced texts.

**Issue 3: Curriculum Gap (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

30 students (7.1%)

Significant gaps between predicted and actual growth indicate disconnect between taught curriculum (100 for 100, SAT Reading) and assessed skills (MAP Reading). Programs may focus on discrete skills rather than integrated comprehension.

**Recommendation:** Map curriculum to MAP Reading domains; add weekly MAP-style practice passages; emphasize sustained reading.

!!! success "Key Insights"
    - **Small campuses with early learners** (Palm Beach, Lake Forest, Plano) show 100% success rates
    - **Alpha High School** struggles with only 55.6% meeting target and 9 students with negative growth
    - **Nova Academy Austin** and **NextGen Academy** are outliers with very low percentages meeting 2X target
    - **Elementary/early learning programs** consistently outperform high school reading programs

### Growth Distribution: Reading

**Negative Growth:** 46 students (10.9% of cohort)
Students experiencing regression. Requires immediate intervention.

**Zero Growth:** 13 students (3.1% of cohort)
No measurable progress. Needs diagnostic assessment.

**Positive Growth:** 48 students (11.4% of cohort)
Growing but below 2X target. Monitor and adjust support.

**Met/Exceeded 2X:** 316 students (74.8% of cohort)
On target or exceeding expectations. Celebrate success.

!!! info "Data Coverage"
    36 students (7.8%) have no growth data available
